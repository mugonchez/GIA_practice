# GIA_practice
Kivy app to reproduce GIA tests

I had to take the test for a job application and I realized that there were no easy ways to practice exhaustively.<br>
Only paid practices.<br>
It surprised me as I didn't think the building of the tests were rocket sciences.<br>
The way results are calculated, I have no idea but it is easy to create your own score in a meaningful way.<br>
To know more about the  GIA test, see the official [page](https://www.thomas.co/sites/default/files/2019-08/GIA-Example-Booklet-2018.pdf)<br><br>
So here we are, this a simple kivy app where you can select any of the 5 tests (so far only the one with numbers) and answer the maximum<br>
of questions in 3mn.<br>
The calculation of score is simple, one good answer +1, one bad answer -1, answer as many questions as you can in 3mn.<br><br>

To start the app run the **game_gia.py**<br><br>

When you click on one of the tests, the first question gets displayed instantly and the timer starts at the same time, so be ready.
